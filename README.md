# React Router Demo (Vite + TailwindCSS)

🎯 This project is part of my **React Journey – Day 10**.  
It demonstrates routing with `react-router-dom` and clean, responsive styling using **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 What I Built

- A reusable `Layout` component with a shared nav
- Nested routing using `<Outlet />` from `react-router-dom`
- Tailwind setup for styling without custom CSS
